# information-retrieval-system

In this repo, an Information Retrieval System based on the Vector Information Retrieval Model is implemented. The design of the system is exposed according to each stage of information retrieval and several of its functionalities are implemented.  A visual interface using `streamlit` is used. In addition, the evaluation of the system is performed on different test collections using different objective metrics.
